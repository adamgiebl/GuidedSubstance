  "description": " Fentanyl is a potent opioid substance of the piperidine class. It is a strong agonist at the μ-opioid receptors and approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (i.e. 100% pure) heroin and roughly 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine",
  "source": "https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Fentanyl",
  "effectsDesc": "Like heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs, fentanyl works by binding to the body's opioid receptors, which are found in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. After taking opioids many times, the brain adapts to the drug, diminishing its sensitivity, making it hard to feel pleasure from anything besides the drug",
